[1mNAME[0m
     [1mscript[0m - make typescript of terminal session

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mscript[0m [[1m-a[0m] [[1m-c[0m [4mCOMMAND[24m] [[1m-f[0m] [[1m-q[0m] [[1m-t[0m] [[4mfile[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mScript[0m makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record
     of an interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).

     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in
     the file [4mtypescript[24m.

     Options:

     [1m-a[0m      Append the output to [4mfile[24m or [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.

     [1m-c[0m [4mCOMMAND[24m
             Run the COMMAND rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a
             program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.

     [1m-f[0m      Flush output after each write. This is nice for telecooperation: One person does â€˜mkfifo foo; script -f fooâ€™ and
             another can supervise real-time what is being done using â€˜cat fooâ€™.

     [1m-q[0m      Be quiet.

     [1m-t[0m      Output timing data to standard error. This data contains two fields, separated by a space. The first field indi-
             cates how much time elapsed since the previous output. The second field indicates how many characters were output
             this time. This information can be used to replay typescripts with realistic typing and output delays.

     The script ends when the forked shell exits (a [4mcontrol-D[24m to exit the Bourne shell (sh(1)), and [4mexit[24m, [4mlogout[24m or [4mcontrol-d[24m
     (if [4mignoreeof[24m is not set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the typescript file.  [1mScript[0m works best with commands that
     do not manipulate the screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
     The following environment variable is utilized by [1mscript[0m:

     SHELL  If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by [1mscript[0m will be that shell. If SHELL is not set, the Bourne shell
            is assumed. (Most shells set this variable automatically).

[1mSEE[0m [1mALSO[0m
     csh(1) (for the [4mhistory[24m mechanism), scriptreplay(1).

[1mHISTORY[0m
     The [1mscript[0m command appeared in 3.0BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
:[K[K     [1mScript[0m places [1meverything[0m in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.  This is not what the naive user expects.
